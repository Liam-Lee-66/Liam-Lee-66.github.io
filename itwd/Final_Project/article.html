            <div class="contentdiv">
                <p>What is Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)? Both SSL and TLS are protocols
                    those are responsible of making a secure internet connection between two different systems. This
                    secure
                    data transferring prevents any criminals from reading or editing the data that is getting
                    transferred
                    between the two systems. The difference between both SSL and TLS is basically when they first came
                    out.
                    TLS is known as SSL’s successor, meaning it’s an upgraded version of SSL. </p>

                    <h4>Try it yourself</h4>
                    <p>You can easily indicate if SSL/TLS is being used in a website. Simply check the top side of your
                        browser
                        and look for the website’s URL address. If the URL address starts with “https”, then the website
                        has
                        been confirmed or verified to be secure. However, if the URL address starts with “http”, it
                        means
                        the
                        website has not yet been confirmed or verified to be secure. </p>

                    <div class="imagediv">
                        <img src="assets/img/ssl2.png">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="spaceout onlyabit">There are also visual indicators in browsers to determine if your website
                    is secure or not. Simply find
                    for the lock icon next to the website’s URL address. Most web browsers have their visual indicators
                    located on the left-hand side of where the URL address is located. Others are mostly located on the
                    right-hand side of where the URL address is located. When the lock icon is not shown and something
                    else
                    or nothing is shown, it means the website is not secure. </p>

                <h4>HTTP vs HTTPS</h4>
                <p>After reading the paragraph above, you may wonder if all http is insecure. The answer is no. Let’s go
                    over this in detail. </p>
                <p>The main purpose of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is showing the client a functioning website.
                    You
                    can interact with the website, navigate around several pages and you will not have any issues.
                    However,
                    the HTTP website is not meant for any secure data transfers between the client and the server. As an
                    example, if you are entering your personal information to login into a HTTP website, there is a
                    possibility where a cybercriminal may interact with your inputted data during its transfer to the
                    server. This type of cyberattack is well known to cybersecurity specialists as, Man-In-The-Middle
                    Attack. </p>
                <p>To prevent this issue, Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) was invented. HTTPS does the exact
                    same
                    job as HTTP, but HTTPS uses SSL to encrypt its information for secure data transferring between the
                    client and server. Here’s an example; Most of the websites you visit, that is needing any type of
                    your
                    personal information is using HTTPS instead of HTTP.</p>
